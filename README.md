# RSA

In this repository I implement the RSA cryptosystem using javascript and plain HTML to practice working on other languages aside from c++ and python. 
In this project I am using the / symbol as a seperator of texts. the HTML file consists of a few functions (like gcd, finding a d value, finding an e value, finding a prime and etc.) which each are needed to implement the RSA cryptosystem.
